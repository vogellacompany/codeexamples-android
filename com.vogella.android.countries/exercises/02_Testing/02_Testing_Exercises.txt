Exercise 1:
-----------
	In this exercise we will create new Android Test Project.

Steps:
	1. Open menu File - New - Other ... - Android / Android Test Project
	2. * Project Name: "com.vogella.android.countries.test"
       * Select "com.vogella.android.countries" as the project to test
	     Press Next
	   * Choose "Android 4.2.2"
	     Press Finish
	     
	   New project "com.vogella.android.countries.test" will appear in your
	   workspace. We are done.


Exercise 2:
-----------
	In this exercise we will create a simple JUnit test case for our CountryUtils class.
	We will extend standard junit.framework.TestCase.
	
Steps:
	1. Continue to work with 
	   the "com.vogella.android.countries.test" project in this exercise.
	2. Create new CountryUtilsText class as following:
	   * Right mouse click on "src" folder - New - JUnit Test Case
	   * Source folder: "com.vogella.android.countries-test/src"
	     Package: "com.vogella.android.countries"
	     Name: "CountryUtilsText"
	     Superclass: "junit.framework.TestCase"
	     Class under test: "com.vogella.android.countries.CountryUtils"
	     Press "Finish"
	3. Create new public testGetCountries() method. In this method we will test 
	   CountryUtils.getCountries() implementation.
	4. Implement the method as following:
	   * Get list of countries by calling CountryUtils.getCountries()
	   * Assert the list is not null. Use Assert.assertNotNull() method.
	   * Assert size of the list. It must not be 0. You might find Assert.assertTrue()
	     method useful for that.
	   * Iterate over all countries and assert that none element of that list is an empty
	    string.
	5. Execute all test cases as following:
	   * Right mouse click on "com.vogella.android.countries.test" project - Run As ... -
	     Android JUnit Test.
	6. Make sure all tests run without errors.


Exercise 3:
-----------
	In this exercise we will create a simple Android Unit Test for our StringListAdapter 
	class. For that we will extend android.test.AndroidTestCase. This class will allows
	us to use Android context class in our tests. 

Steps:
	1. Copy /exercises/02/SimpleAndroidTestCase.java file located in 
	   com.vogella.android.countries project to the "src/com/vogella/android/countries/" folder
	   of com.vogella.android.countries.test.
	2. Solve all TODO's in the test file.
	3. Execute all tests and make sure test case runs with no errors.
